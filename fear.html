          <h4>Day 1: Arrival</h4>
          <h6>08/26/2017</h6>
					<p>Fear is a double-edged sword. Fear keeps us alive and prevents us from living. Traveling to Japan scared me. There was not only a lot of unknows, but a lot of first for me. Up to this point in my life my travel experience was limited to cars and never really leaving the Southern United States. Yet here I was about to take my first plane ride. I had not even been in an airport up to that point. Then I would be arriving in a country that I know little about regarding language and culture at that time. You will never experience anything if you don't eventually just do it. </p>
					<p>Luis and I arrived at the airport early as required for international trips. At this point I had been awake for over 24 hours. The adrenaline rushing through my body powered by nerves and excitement kept me sharp enough to keep going easy enough. After security, which really was not too bad, it was just waiting anxious to board the plane. Waiting is the worst, when there is nothing to do but wait it is easy to start getting into your own head. I started questioning whether a 15-hour plain ride 6,454 mi away from home for my first international trip was the best idea I had. </p>
					<P>I have learned though in some situations it is best to let your feet do the thinking. My feet led me to my seat on the plain even as my mind, which was scared and unsure told me this was probably not my best decision. Buckled up and nowhere to go I set back and hope for the best. Luckily enough I took to flying pretty easily, small spaces don't bother me and the takeoff and landing was like a roller coaster ride. We had a quick 3-hour plane ride to San Francisco for a 4-hour layover. All that waiting I still could not sleep. Despite having 3 hours of flying experience now I found myself getting more anxious. The next plane will be taking me across the Pacific Ocean and out of the United States. When the time came, I again let my feet lead the way. At this point not even my adrenaline could keep me awake. After the plane settled down from the takeoff I knocked out. So much so I slept through the dinner meal that was handed out. </P>
					<p> We landed at Narita International Airport. I was herded off the plane with the rest of the passengers. Culture shock hit me fast. The best guess was to follow the other people and hope for the best. Ending up at costumes we were given forms to fill out, luckily, they had English. Still was not sure what I was doing, just hoped there would be no issues. Despites lines of waiting people, everything felt like double speed as I struggled to keep up. Everything that came to me as second nature at home was now a struggle. I was not confident about anything. Most of everything I couldn't understand. People walked quickly past us as we stumbled around trying to figure things out. Then it kind of hit me. This must be how people feel coming to America and not knowing English. I never really thought about how terrifying it could be to feel so lost and out of place. What was day to day for everyone else was absolute chaos for me. The small comfort I had was that I wasn't going it alone. Everything was moving fast and my mind raced. Done with Costumes what now. Need to get my bag, where is that? Found bag, what's next? Need to get to the Hotel. Wait...how do we do that? </p> 
					<p>Pause... quick side note. Luis and I did not plan well. Up to this point we had our plain tickets planned, our Hotels, cities we planned to visit and... that is it. We had a general idea what we wanted to do and how to go about it. But outside of that everything was pretty must winged. It was intentional though as we didn't want to be tied to a schedule, but it did backfire at times though. </p>
					<p>Okay go! Need to get to Hotel. Wait how do we get there, we need internet. Awesome, Airport has internet and we paid for a service that allowed us to connect to hot spots around Japan that we found. We can take a train! Sounds easy enough, wait how do trains work. Yes, I did not know how to get train tickets or how the train system worked. That too was a first for me as I had never taken public transportation. Everything just felt so new. I felt uneasy. I know that sounds bad but looking back I have fondness for the experience. Learning that feeling of being out of place made me reevaluate a lot, it was new and helped open my world to just how much more there is outside the comfort of my home.  Despite having some fear, I did not let it stop me from living. It was not until I was on my first train ride and on the way to the Hotel that I really felt like I could breath. The world around my slow back down to my pace. </p>
